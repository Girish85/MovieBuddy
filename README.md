# MovieBuddy
This is an Android application based on movies using TMDB Api. This project is still in development phase.
In the First Increment,
        Movie Listings Screen is finished by using Recycler View and TMDB Api and also Card view is used to represent
        each item in view.
        An Automatic Image slider at the top is designed using View Flipper but is not yet integrated with Movie Listings Screen
        and also image slider is developed using static images and not using TMDB Api.
